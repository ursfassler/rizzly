Feature: The order of operation (operator precedence) is unambigous defined
  As a developer
  I want to use implicit but unambigous defined defined order of operation
  In order to write small expressions which always means the same
  see also http://www.gnu-pascal.de/gpc/Built_002din-Operators.html

#TODO implement order of operation checks
#TODO prescedence: unary > binary > others
#TODO all binary operation have the same presecendence
#TODO for more than 2 operands, braces are needed: 2 + (3 + 4)
